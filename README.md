## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed.  
* A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.  
* [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed (npm install \-g firebase-tools).

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/flutter\_ecommerce\_app.git\](https://github.com/your-username/flutter\_ecommerce\_app.git)  
cd flutter\_ecommerce\_app

### **2\. Configure Firebase**

This project uses a .gitignore to keep the firebase\_options.dart file private. You must generate your own.

* Run the FlutterFire configuration tool in the project root:  
  flutterfire configure

* Follow the CLI prompts to connect the app to your own Firebase project. This will automatically generate the lib/firebase\_options.dart file.

### **3\. Set Up Firestore Database**

* In your Firebase Console, navigate to **Firestore Database** and create a new database.  
* Start in **Test Mode** for initial development.  
* **Crucially, you must manually create the products collection:**  
  1. Click **\+ Start collection** and name it products.  
  2. Add your first document with an **Auto-ID**.  
  3. Add the required fields: name (String), price (Number), imageUrl (String), and description (String).  
  4. The users and orders collections will be created automatically by the app.

### **4\. Run the App**

\# Get all the dependencies  
flutter pub get

\# Run the application  
flutter run

## **üîë Admin Access**

To access the powerful admin panel:

1. Sign up for a new account in the app using the email: admin@example.com  
2. You can use any password you like.  
3. Log in with these credentials. An "Admin Panel" icon will now appear in the app bar on the home screen.
